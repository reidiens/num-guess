# Number Guessing Game
Guess the numbers and have lots of fun!

A random number from 1 to 100 is generated, and it's your job to guess what it is! I made this to play around with random number generation. I also thought it was nigh time I made some sort of game in C. Are there other types of games I could've made? Yeah. Was this the best possible game I could've chosen, though? Hell yes.
