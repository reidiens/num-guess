# Number Guessing Game
Guess the numbers and have lots of fun!

A random number from 1 to 100 is generated, and it's your job to guess what it is! I made this to play around with random number generation. I also thought it was nigh time I made some sort of game in C. This is literally the pinnacle of gaming.

## Known Errors/Stuff to Fix:
 
 - Inputting a character string of length n (instead of a number) prints the error message n times (e.g., inputting asdf prints the error message 4 times)
